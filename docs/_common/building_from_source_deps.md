To build PIQP it is required to have [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Eigen 3.3.4+](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) and a compatible compiler like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) installed. CMake and a compatible compiler should already be installed on most systems.

### Installing Eigen on macOS via Homebrew

```shell
brew install eigen
```

### Installing Eigen on Ubuntu
